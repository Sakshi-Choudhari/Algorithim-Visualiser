# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a desktop application designed to help users learn and understand various algorithms through interactive visualizations. The application allows users to visualize the operation of different algorithms in real-time, promoting deeper comprehension of how these algorithms work.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Firebase integration for secure login and user management.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step rendering of graph and search algorithms.
  - Supported algorithms:
    - A* Algorithm
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Greedy Best-First Search
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust dataset size and animation speed for personalized visualizations.
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic visual cues to enhance learning and understanding.
- **Intuitive UI**: User interface built using Tkinter for a seamless experience.

## How to Use

1. **Login**: Start by logging into the application using Firebase authentication.
2. **Setup Parameters**: Configure the algorithm's parameters, such as dataset size and animation speed.
